NAME
    Task::Devel::Cover::Recommended - Install Devel::Cover and its
    recommended dependencies.

VERSION
    Version v0.930.1

SYNOPSIS
        $ cpan Task::Devel::Cover::Recommended
        $ cpanp -i Task::Devel::Cover::Recommended
        $ cpanm Task::Devel::Cover::Recommended

DESCRIPTION
    This task module lets you easily install Devel::Cover 0.93 and all its
    recommended dependencies.

DEPENDENCIES
  Configure-time dependencies
    *   ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  Build-time and test-time dependencies
    *   ExtUtils::MakeMaker

    *   Test::Differences

    *   Test::More

    *   Test::Warn

  Run-time dependencies
    *   Devel::Cover 0.93

    *   "perl" 5.008002

    *   Browser::Open

    *   Digest::MD5

    *   JSON::PP

    *   PPI::HTML 1.07

        Devel::Cover lets you optionally pick between PPI::HTML and
        Perl::Tidy, but it will only use the former if both are installed.

    *   Parallel::Iterator

    *   Pod::Coverage 0.06

    *   Pod::Coverage::CountParents

    *   Storable

    *   Template 2.00

CAVEATS
    Note that run-time dependencies that are only recommended by
    Devel::Cover may not yet be installed at the time Devel::Cover is
    tested, as there is no explicit dependency link between them and in that
    case most CPAN clients default to install prerequisites in alphabetic
    order. However, they will be installed when
    Task::Devel::Cover::Recommended is, thus will be available when you
    actually use Devel::Cover.
